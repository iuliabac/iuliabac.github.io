    <h1>Bacanu Iulia's Profile</h1>
    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>I am from Romania and was born in Bucharest, the capital city, on 10th of March. </p>
    <p>For as long as I can remember, I have been obsessed with computers. I would play games on it, surf the web, and even fix and analyze data and folders.</p> 
    <p>I am a very organized individual when it comes to data. Most of my projects involve using Excel or Sheets. These projects include collections of various interests that I have, such as music and videos. Each one is categorized by country of origin, creator, and year, with the title added next to it. </p>
